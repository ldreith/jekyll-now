# Occupancy

## Application Process
The application process for each of the houses in POOCH is standardized. Applications will be completed on the online Google Form managed by the POOCH Occupancy Email. Notifications for when a new application is submitted will be automatically sent to each of the houses, and the Occupancy Coordinators for the houses the applicant applied to will then be responsible for coordinating the interview and bringing their house to a vote.
